# investigraph-datasets-tests

Dataset definitions and parsing code for [investigraph etl](https://github.com/investigativedata/investigraph-etl)

This repository only holds the dataset specific metadata & code to be used as a [Block](https://docs.prefect.io/2.10.11/concepts/blocks/) within a prefect.io deployment.

This specific repo serves as a repo to test **investigraph** against without loading datasets to production storage (as seen in [this repo](https://github.com/investigativedata/investigraph-tests))

## add as block

    investigraph add-block -b github/investigraph-datasets -u https://github.com/investigativedata/investigraph-datasets
